QA

 ● Description of bugs that came up- how you noticed and fixed them
-low FPS because i didn't preload the shaders. Fixed by preloading them instead of reinitiating them every frame.
-By making my own level implementations first, i got a bug with colors of NORDEUS difficulty. But since NORDEUS matrix is composed of very large islands with very big heights(0 to 1000) i just left it like this since we can even call it a feature like this :)
-Game was at first too hard, so had to switch thing up, so i made it very easy and by having the old code i just made 2 difficulties, easy and hard which are part of the game now.



 ● Ways you would test the projects of other contestants (inputs, actions you would do etc.)
Mostly by trying out the game itself, maybe trying to break a thing or two just to make sure everything is ready. I would also go over code so i can maybe get some critical error that can be introduced due to mishandling of code.



 ● Improvements/features you would make if you had a magic wand (able to do anything
 you wish for)
If i had more time definitely leaderboard, timer for average completion, global ranking, better graphics and maybe some more animations.


 ● Think of how some factors could affect your solution (e.g. map size, number of lives…)
Map size would make hard difficulty extremely unlikely to be beaten. Number of lives could even go higher for such difficulty so i am okay with that but not with map size i guess :D


● Dev notes
Press P to pause the game. By pressing P you will access a menu which has CHEATS feature (among other) for you to turn on if you want to.
Left click to select Island you thing has greatest height.
ESC can be used when inside the game to QUIT the game itself. Otherwise use X button.
By pressing MUSIC in Menu you will change the Music to different one.
Requires pygame and requests in order to work on your PC (pip install).
